# FDIALAB
A False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) Simulator (development branch)

# Prerequisites
The application is only tested with python version Python 3.10.10, although I believe one should be able to run the application with slightly older python versions as well. However, older versions than 3.10 won't work (as the code contains "match case" statements). Other than that, you also need to install "pandapower" (https://pandapower.readthedocs.io/en/v2.10.1/about.html).

To use the autoencoder-based detection algorithm ("autoencoder_9bus.py"), you must also install "tensorflow" (https://www.tensorflow.org/)

# Instructions
1. Clone the repo, cd into it with git bash and run the command ``` git checkout dev ``` (to change to the development branch). 
2. Run the command: ``` python -B main.py ```  
3. Wait until the control panel window pops up
4. ---TBD---

# System Architecture
This section aims to describe the application's overall architecture. After reading this section, you will get a general sense of the most relevant components of the application. However, to understand the application more in-depth, please turn to the comments in the code.
